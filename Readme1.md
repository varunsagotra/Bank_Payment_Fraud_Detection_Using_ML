Fraud Detection with Machine Learning On Banksim Payment Transaction Dataset - ( Dataset Name bs140513_032310)

Due to fraudulent transactions businesses lose millions of dollars each year and same behavior has been observed across many different fields such as e-commerce, UPI payment (digital banking), healthcare and regular banking systems.

Frauds can be detected via Automated detection system for that there are different approaches including rule based approaches and machine learning.
This repository uses the latter approach for classification of fraudulent transactions. The synthetically generated dataset consists of payments from various customers made in different time periods and with different amounts 
Below is a quick recap of the classification results of the machine learning models used in the script.

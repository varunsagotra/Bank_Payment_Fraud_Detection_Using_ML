# # `Fraud Detection on Bank Payments`
# 
# Fraud Detection with Machine Learning On Banksim Payment Transaction Dataset 
# (Dataset Name: bs140513_032310)
# 
# Due to fraudulent transactions businesses lose millions of dollars each year and same behavior has been observed across many different fields such as e-commerce, UPI payment (digital banking), healthcare and regular banking systems.
# 
# Frauds can be detected via Automated detection system for that there are different approaches including rule based approaches and machine learning.This repository uses the latter approach for classification of fraudulent transactions. The synthetically generated dataset consists of payments from various customers made in different time  
# 
# Fraud is a billion-dollar business and it is increasing every year. The PwC global economic crime survey of 2018 [1] found that half (49 percent) of the 7,200 companies they surveyed had experienced fraud of some kind.
# 
# Even if fraud seems to be scary for businesses it can be detected using intelligent systems such as rules engines or machine learning. Most people here in Kaggle are familier with machine learning but for rule engines here is a quick information. 
# 
# A rules engine is a software system that executes one or more business rules in a runtime production environment. These rules are generally written by domain experts for transferring the knowledge of the problem to the rules engine and from there to production. Two rules examples for fraud detection would be limiting the number of transactions in a time period (velocity rules),  denying the transactions which come from previously known fraudulent IP's and/or domains.
#     
# Rules are great for detecting some type of frauds but they can fire a lot of false positives or false negatives in some cases because they have predefined threshold values. For example let's think of a rule for denying a transaction which has an amount that is bigger than 10000 dollars for a specific user. If this user is an experienced fraudster, he/she may be aware of the fact that the system would have a threshold and he/she can just make a transaction just below the threshold value (9999 dollars).
# 
# `For these type of problems ML comes for help and reduce the risk of frauds and the risk of business to lose money. With the combination of rules and machine learning, detection of the fraud would be more precise and confident.`
# 
# ## Dataset (Banksim Data)
# 
# We detect the fraudulent transactions from the Banksim dataset. This synthetically generated dataset consists of payments from various customers made in different time periods and with different amounts. 
# For more information on the dataset you can check the [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/banksim1) for this dataset which also has the link to the original paper.

# # `Meta Data`
# 
# As we can see in the first rows below the dataset has 9 feature columns and a target column. 
# The feature columms are :
# * **Step**: This feature represents the day from the start of simulation. It has 180 steps so simulation ran for virtually 6 months.
# * **Customer**: This feature represents the customer id
# * **zipCodeOrigin**: The zip code of origin/source.
# * **Merchant**: The merchant's id
# * **zipMerchant**: The merchant's zip code
# * **Age**: Categorized age 
#     * 0: <= 18, 
#     * 1: 19-25, 
#     * 2: 26-35, 
#     * 3: 36-45,
#     * 4: 46:55,
#     * 5: 56:65,
#     * 6: > 65
#     * U: Unknown
# * **Gender**: Gender for customer
#      * E : Enterprise,
#      * F: Female,
#      * M: Male,
#      * U: Unknown
# * **Category**: Category of the purchase. I won't write all categories here, we'll see them later in the analysis.
# * **Amount**: Amount of the purchase
# * **Fraud**: Target variable which shows if the transaction fraudulent(1) or benign(0)

# **Fraud data** will be imbalanced like you see in the plot below and from the count of instances. To balance the dataset one can perform oversample or undersample techniques. Oversampling is increasing the number of the minority class by generating instances from the minority class . Undersampling is reducing the number of instances in the majority class by selecting random points from it to where it is equal with the minority class. Both operations have some risks: Oversample will create copies or similar data points which sometimes would not be helpful for the case of fraud detection because fraudulent transactions may vary. Undersampling means that we lost data points thus information. We will perform an oversampled technique called SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). SMOTE will create new data points from minority class using the neighbour instances so generated samples are not exact copies but they are similar to instances we have.

# Create two dataframes with fraud and non-fraud data

#print(data.fraud.value_counts()) # does the same thing above


# We can see the mean amount and fraud percent by category below. Looks like leisure and the travel is the most selected categories for fraudsters. Fraudsters chose the categories which people spend more on average. Let's confirm this hypothesis by checking the fraud and non-fraud amount transacted.

# In[6]:


print("Mean feature values per category",data.groupby('category')['amount','fraud'].mean())


# Our hypothesis for fraudsters choosing the categories which people spend more is only partly correct, but as we can see in the table below we can confidently say that a fraudulent transaction will be much more (about four times or more) than the average for that category.

# In[7]:


# Create two dataframes with fraud and non-fraud data 
pd.concat([df_fraud.groupby('category')['amount'].mean(),df_non_fraud.groupby('category')['amount'].mean(),           data.groupby('category')['fraud'].mean()*100],keys=["Fraudulent","Non-Fraudulent","Percent(%)"],axis=1,          sort=False).sort_values(by=['Non-Fraudulent'])

# ## Data Preprocessing
# 
# In this part we will preprocess the data and prepare for the training.
# 
# There are only one unique zipCode values so we will drop them.

# Checking the data after dropping.

# Here we will transform categorical features into numerical values. It is usually better to turn these type of categorical values into dummies because they have no relation in size(i.e. customer1 is not greater than customer2) but since they are too many (over 500k customers and merchants) the features will grow 10^5 in size and it will take forever to train. I've put the code below for turning categorical features into dummies if you want to give it a try.
# > data_reduced.loc[:,['customer','merchant','category']].astype('category')
# > data_dum = pd.get_dummies(data_reduced.loc[:,['customer','merchant','category','gender']],drop_first=True) # dummies
# > print(data_dum.info())

# turning object columns type to categorical for easing the transformation process
col_categorical = data_reduced.select_dtypes(include= ['object']).columns

# categorical values ==> numeric values

# The fraud datasets will be imbalanced and most of the instances will be non-fraudulent. Imagine that we have the dataset here and we are always predicting non-fraudulent. Our accuracy would be almost 99 % for this dataset and mostly for others as well since fraud percentage is very low. Our accuracy is very high but we are not detecting any frauds so it is a useless classifier. So the base accuracy score should be better at least than predicting always non-fraudulent for performing a detection.

# In[37]:


# The base score should be better than predicting always non-fraduelent

# ## Conclusion
# 
# In this kernel we have tried to do fraud detection on a bank payment data and we have achieved remarkable results with our classifiers. Since fraud datasets have an imbalance class problem we performed an oversampling technique called SMOTE and generated new minority class examples.
# 
# Thanks for taking the time to read / view the results from my first kernel i hope you enjoyed it.
# Wish you to have a great day with lots of beautiful data!!!
